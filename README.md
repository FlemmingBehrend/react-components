# react-components

This is a collection of React components that I've built for my own projects. I've tried to make them as generic as possible, but they may not be useful for everyone.

Components are based on the [Material Design](https://material.io/) spec. and are build based on [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

## Installation

```bash
TBD
```
